              H. Recommendation (state further the needs for improvement in the working relationship)<br><br>
              The worker therefore recommend the following: 
              <p>
                </p><p>Here is a general recommendation for the person with presenting problems of insomnia, lack of energy, and stress: </p>

<p>1. Assess and Address Acute Causes of Insomnia and Stress: The person should prioritize identifying any immediate stressors or reasons for their insomnia. They should assess if there are any imminent personal or professional life challenges, outstanding personal or work-related obligations, or any other urgent matters that may be causing or contributing to their insomnia and stress. </p>

<p>2. Practice Good Sleep Hygiene: Following good sleep hygiene practices is essential for improving sleep quality. This includes having a pre-sleep routine that prepares your body and mind for a restful night, such as limiting screen time before bed, keeping your room cool, dark, and quiet, and avoiding stimulating activities close to bedtime. </p>

<p>3. Adjust Sleep Schedules: To facilitate a quicker fall asleep and improve sleep duration, evaluate their current sleep schedule and try to adhere to a consistent sleep and wake-up time, even on weekends. Gradually adjust their bedtime and wake time, aiming for a schedule that allows for 7-9 hours of sleep at night. </p>

<p>4. Manage Stress and Anxiety: Explore different manageable techniques to help combat stress and promote relaxation. Techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness can help the person reduce pre-sleep anxiety and improve the quality of their sleep. </p>

<p>5. Light Therapy and Daytime Exposure to Natural Light: Considering the association between exposure to sunlight or bright daylight and the body's circadian rhythm, the individual should aim to spend timely daylight hours outdoors, exercise outdoors, or utilize a light therapy fixture as a supplementary light source. </p>

<p>6. Evaluate Diet and Dietary Supplements: In collaboration with a medical professional, evaluate their diet and nutritional habits. Certain dietary choices may disrupt sleep, while others can potentially support a healthy sleep cycle. Likewise, while avoiding stimulant substances, one should carefully examine any herbal or over-the-counter supplements that may promote sleep and evaluate them for potential side effects and interactions. </p>

<p>7. Physical Exercise: Incorporating consistent, manageable exercise, such as brisk walking, yoga, jogging, or other aerobic activities, into their daily routine can help promote sleepiness at night and alleviate stress. </p>

<p>8. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Consider exploring cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with a licensed practitioner. CBT helps to identify and challenge negative thoughts and behaviors that affect sleep. </p>

<p>9. Medical Intervention: If the problems persist, despite attempting these interventions, it is important to consult a medical doctor, as some cases of insomnia may be caused by an underlying condition, or may require further examination to determine if pharmacological intervention is right for you. </p>

<p>Remember, this is not a substitute for medical consultation, whereby a detailed history and personalized management options will be provided.</p>
