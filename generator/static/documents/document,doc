              H. Recommendation (state further the needs for improvement in the working relationship)<br><br>
              The worker therefore recommend the following: 
              <p>
                </p><p>Here is a recommendation for an action plan for insomnia, lack of energy, and stress: </p>

<p>1. Speak to a doctor, physician, or mental health professional: Insomnia can be linked to a larger issue such as depression and anxiety. It is important to understand your symptoms under the guidance of a professional who can offer diagnosis and treatment options, such as therapy and medication. </p>

<p>2. Create a comfortable sleep environment and routine: Implementing healthy habits before bed can improve the quality of sleep. In preparation for bedtime, the bedroom should be cool, dark, and quiet. Make sure to avoid screens for at least 30 minutes before going to sleep. Consider taking a warm bath, reading, or practicing deep breathing exercises to calm your mind and prepare your body for sleep. Additionally, try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day to establish a consistent sleep routine. </p>

<p>3. Practice stress management and relaxation techniques: Finding healthy outlets for stress and engaging in practices that calm your mind can improve insomnia and lack of energy. Consider trying different stress-reduction strategies, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, journaling, or mindfulness practices. Experiment with various techniques to find what works best for you. </p>

<p>4. Exercise regularly: Exercise helps to relieve stress, increase energy levels, and improve the quality of sleep. Aim to engage in regular aerobic exercise, such as walking, jogging, swimming, or cycling, to boost your overall health and well-being. Try not to exercise too close to your bedtime as this may interfere with your ability to fall asleep. </p>

<p>5. Evaluate nutrition and diet: Consuming a variety of healthy foods can improve mood and energy levels. Avoid consumption of stimulants, such as caffeine, and alcohol, especially close to bedtime. Try incorporating foods that contain magnesium, zinc, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids into your diet, as these have been linked to better sleep. </p>

<p>6. Reduce exposure to blue light: Blue light is produced by electronic devices such as phones, computers, and TVs. Reducing exposure to this type of light especially close to bedtime can improve sleep quality. You can adjust the settings on your devices to filter out blue light, or consider using glasses that protect against this type of light. </p>

<p>7. Try Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of therapy that can help you identify and change thought patterns and behaviors that cause you issues. CBT can be broken down into sessions that focus on different topics such as sleep hygiene education, sleep environment optimization, sleep scheduling, stress and anxiety reduction, relaxation training, and cognitive restructuring. </p>

<p>This is not a complete treatment plan, but rather a starting point for addressing these issues. The recommendations provided in this action plan are intended to support your overall health and well-being. Consulting a medical professional should always be the first step in dealing with medical and mental health issues.</p>
